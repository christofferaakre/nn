# nn - the shitty deep learning framework
This is the shitty deep learning framework I built when I was going through `Andrew Trask - Grokking Deep Learning`.
## Goal of this project
* Learn about the techniques used in deep learning, such as convolutions, linear layers, nonlinearities, batching, indexing, autograd, etc.
* prime myself for the APIs of popular deep learning frameworks, in particular `pytorch`

## Results
It worked out pretty well. The framework itself is complete trash.
However, making a good framework was not the point, rather to familiarise myself with deep learning concepts and the API of deep learning frameworks as staed above. In that regard, this was a great success, because when I started learning `pytorch`, the syntax did indeed feel very familiar, and I feel like I have a good basic understanding of important deep learning concepts. This project has given me a good foundation on which I can build my understanding of machine learning.
